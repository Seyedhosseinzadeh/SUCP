## Leveraging Social Influence based on Users Activity Centers for Point-of-Interest Recommendation ()


Direct Friends (i.e., users who follow each other in an LBSN) and Distant Friends (i.e., users with commonly visited check-ins) usually have close opinions, even some friendships are made because of these behavioral similarities. Our analysis reveals the social behavior pattern of users for geographic activity centers. This paper proposes a new approach that examines user's preferences based on three contextual factors: geographical, social, and temporal information. we compare the performance of our SUCP with its variant, called SUCP-NoSocial.
